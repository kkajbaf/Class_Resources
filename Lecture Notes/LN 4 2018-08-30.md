# Class Housekeeping

## Review: what we've seen
* layers of abstraction
* the bash shell
	* file management commands
	* process management commands
	* regular expressions

## objectives for this class
* learn git 
	* local versus remote repos
	* cloning
	* branch management
	* version management, stage/commit
	* workflow

# git

Review of version control

local/remote repos

private/public repos (collaborators)

* Branches
	* Master, HEAD, others
	
* enables roll-backs

## git desktop

Go through interface

* *stage/commit* tab versus *History* tab
* branch
	* graphic of versions
* update branch
* sync: update remote (online) version

Look at course repo in more detail

## github (online)

* clone
* push/pull (briefly)

## Good Habits ##

* keep local and remote in sync
	* (for class repo, which you don't modify) Sync every time to get latest versions
	* don't change stuff in a different repo (*serious trouble*)

* Branches
	* use good names for Branches
	* Master branch has what you're willing for others to see
	* Always work in a side branch
		* commit often, in atomic units, using good descriptions and titles
		* update master when you're satisfied with your development branch

Keep track of which repo and branch you are working, including remote/local

# introduction to programming

* What is a program? 
* Kinds of programs: interpreted, compiled, in-between

Steps to learning how to program. It's like writing a book/paper

* Syntax: command by command (iPython is good for this)
* Stand-alone programs: building programs as files (TextWranger is good for this)
* Using other people's code: packages (pandas, matplotlib, e.g.)
* Style: writing **good** code

Most programming is *re-programming*, not creating things from scratch
