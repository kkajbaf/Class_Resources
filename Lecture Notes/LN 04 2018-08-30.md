# objectives for this class
* learn git 
	* local versus remote repos
	* cloning
	* branch management
	* version management, stage/commit
	* workflow
* more bash, especially *grep*

# Review: what we've seen/done

* layers of abstraction
* the bash shell (via Terminal)
	* file management commands
	* process management commands
	* regular expressions
* github desktop and online
* created local repos and class directory structure

# more bash

## more useful stuff
* regular expressions in bash
	* \* and \? as wildcards 
		* ls 19\*
		* ls [aA]nd	
	* in \~/tmp: ls b; ls b\*; ls b?
	* works for all bash commands: touch, cat, rm, ...
	
* ls -la and ls -l
	* Permissions, chmod (briefly, we'll cover it again when we do python scripts)
* head, tail
* less
* echo
* cat

## streams and pipes

* I/O, STDOUT, STDIN, STDERR
* |, >, <

* wc (show example on fasta file)
* file

## processes

* describe what they are
* ps, who, sort

* ctl-C stops processes
* ctl-Q force quits what is running

## Information
* man, less

## Regular expressions and grep 

Sample files in Datatsets/milk\_sequences.fasta

* grep for strings in a file or bunch of files: 
	* grep "FUT" Datatsets/milk\_sequences.fasta
	* grep "THIS" Datatsets/\*.fasta
* case insensitive
	* grep -i "fut" grep\_example.txt
* Using patterns
	* grep FU? Datatsets/milk\_sequences.fasta
* Sets
	*  grep [FfGg]* Datatsets/milk\_sequences.fasta (character sets)
*  Using pattern modifiers
	* grep ^[GC]GCC Datasets/milk\_sequences.fasta (^ as beginning marker)
	* grep CCATTACAATTTATAGCCAT$ Datasets/milk\_sequences.fasta ($ as end marker)
	* grep ^$ Datasets/milk\_sequences.fasta (empty lines)
* useful flags
	* grep -c (count) 
	* grep -n (show line number)
	* grep -w (limit match to full words)
	* grep -i (ignore case)

## Putting It All Together

Datasets/milk\_sequences.fasta has 5,379,622 DNA sequences (a **small** HiSeq run)

show comment format. Includes: person's name, which gene this is for, primers, and more.

* How many sequences for FUT2 gene?
* How many people from Ghana (GN*)
* How many records for person GN531?
* How many FUT2 genes were sequenced from Ghana?

Do grep. pipe to wc, less, grep -c, etc.

## (time permitting) System Variables

* set
* $PATH

# git

Review of version control

local/remote repos

private/public repos (collaborators)

* Branches
	* Master, HEAD, others
	
* enables roll-backs

## github desktop

github desktop keeps track of changes on your computer and coordinates them with your remote git repo.
It is *not* a file manager.
To get to your local git repo, cntl-click the repo name (or just go there in Finder or Terminal)

* *stage/commit* tab versus *History* tab
* branch
	* graphic of versions	
* update branch
* sync: update remote (online) version


* walkthrough

1. create local sandbox/git_demo repo 
2. create in\_process branch
3. edit a file in in\_process

	a. commit
	
	b. make a change (add a line)
	
	c. compare to master branch, show change history
	
5. update master from in\_process, switch to master	

	a. show file in both branches (the same!)
	
	b. show change history in graph
	
6. show it isn't in remote repo

	a. sync, show it's there now

## github (online)

* clone

* push/pull (briefly)

explore link in top: do an example

## Good Habits ##

* keep local and remote in sync
	* (for class repo, which you don't modify) Sync every time to get latest versions
	* don't change stuff in a different repo (*serious trouble*)

* Branches
	* use good names for Branches
	* Master branch has what you're willing for others to see
	* Always work in a side branch
		* commit often, in atomic units, using good descriptions and titles
		* update master when you're satisfied with your development branch

Keep track of which repo and branch you are working, including remote/local

# (if time) introduction to programming

* What is a program? 
* Kinds of programs: interpreted, compiled, in-between

Steps to learning how to program. It's like writing a book/paper

* Syntax: command by command (iPython is good for this)
* Stand-alone programs: building programs as files (TextWranger is good for this)
* Using other people's code: packages (pandas, matplotlib, e.g.)
* Style: writing **good** code

Most programming is *re-programming*, not creating things from scratch
