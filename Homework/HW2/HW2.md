# Homework 2: a simple python program

Here, you will write a simple python program. Note that this one can be ugly if necessary, but it has to be correct. We will modify this in later homework.

**Assigned:** 24 September

**Due:** 11 September (Class 7)

Please put all your work in a directory named *HW2* on your private repo, so we can keep the different homework solutions separated.

## Readings ##

See the *Class_Preparation* folder for how to prepare for classes.

Remember: in your readings it will help to try out the things you read about on a computer; and to keep track of confusing or unclear terms, examples, and errors you discover so we can discuss them in class.

## Practice basic python

0. Create a directory named *HW2* in your private, homework repo.
(Remember to include a *README.md*!)
1. copy *HW2_Worksheet.ipynb* into this *HW2* directory
2. fill out this worksheet.

## Turn in homework
1. Commit your work
2. Update your local master
3. Sync with the remote master

## Grading
We will grade your homework by the accuracy of the contents of the worksheety.

For this assignment, we will grade on a three point scale: 0 if you don't do it, 1 if you do it but the output is incorrect, 4 if the output is correct (corresponds loosely to F, D, A).
