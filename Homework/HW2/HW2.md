# Homework 2: a simple python program

Here, you will write a simple python program. Note that this one can be ugly if necessary, but it has to be correct. We will modify this in later homework.

**Assigned:** 4 September, lecture 5

**Due:** 13 September (Class 8)

Please put all your work in a directory named *HW2* on your private repo, so we can keep the different homework solutions separated.

## Readings ##

See the *Class_Preparation* folder for how to prepare for classes.

Remember: in your readings it will help to try out the things you read about on a computer; and to keep track of confusing or unclear terms, examples, and errors you discover so we can discuss them in class.

## Practice basic python

0. Create a directory named *HW2* in your private, homework repo.
(Remember to include a *README.md*!)
1. copy *HW2_Worksheet.ipynb* into this *HW2* directory
2. fill out this worksheet.

## Turn in homework
1. Commit your work
2. Update your local master
3. Sync with the remote master

## Grading
We will grade your homework by the accuracy of the contents of the worksheety.

grade | if
----- | :---------
0     | you don't turn in anything (in the *master* branch of *HW6* in your private repo)
1     | you turn in something but it isn't correct
2     | you turn in something, some is correct but some isn't
3     | All of your code is correct, but it violates proper style, or has poor/missing comments
4     | what you turned in is correct, stylish, and complete
