    "**Note:** If you are enrolled in Bio 456 (the undergraduate version of this course) you *do not have to do* this assignment!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have enrolled in this course as Bio 549, for graduate credit, then you need to do a class project. The project should use what you have learned in this course to analyze a \"real\" biological dataset. Simulation data are ok if your research involves simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "My hope is that you will use data relevant to your thesis. If you do not yet have a thesis topic, this is a chance to explore something that might become your thesis. If you are deep into your thesis work, this can be a next step. \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is an informal initial proposal of an idea or two that might interest you. I will look these over, then you and I will have a conversation (perhaps by email) to refine the topic. You will submit a refined proposal in a week or two.\n",
