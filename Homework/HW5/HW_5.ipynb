    "Remember the central dogma of genetics: DNA sequences are translated into proteins (sequences of amino acids), through an RNA intermediate mechanism, by replacing codons (see Lecture 10).\n",
    "The (most common) mapping of codons to amino acids, known as the *translation table*, is given in the notes for Lecture 20, on 20 September. \n",
    "Translation begins with the codon *ATG*, skipping sequence before that if necessary.\n",
    "Translation continues until it reaches a *stop codon*: *TAA*, *TAG*, or *TGA*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The region of the DNA between *ATG* and a stop codon is called an *open reading frame* (ORF). \n",
    "By convention, we are excluding the start and stop codons from the ORF.\n",
    "An ORF is potentially a gene, since it has the potential to be translated into protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember also that DNA sequences have six *reading frames*, three in the 5' to 3' direction, each offset by one nucleotide from the other two; and three on the reverse complement sequence (the 5' to 3' sequence reversed, with A, C, G, T replaced by T, G, C, A respectively). \n",
    "Thus, an **open** reading frame is part of a given reading frame which may be translated into a protein sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be given a DNA sequence, which by convention is in the 5' to 3' direction. \n",
    "We are ignoring all other reading frames.\n",
